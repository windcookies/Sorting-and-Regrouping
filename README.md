# Sorting-and-Regrouping
An Advanced Differential Voltage Vector-Based Rejection and Clustering Method for Enhancing Consistency in Reuse of Retired Batteries
This repository is created to share the data used in our authors' research paper. 
The data comes from a retired battery energy storage station project in Henan, China, using 252 LFP prismaticbatteries. 
The recording dates range from November 7, 2021, to June 11, 2022. 
The data is in .mat format, consisting of 220 .mat files, each recording data for one day. 
Each .mat file is composed of 252 cells, with each cell recording data for one battery. Inside each cell is a four-column matrix, representing time (s), current (A), voltage (V), and temperature (â„ƒ).
